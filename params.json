Contributions and/or suggestions are welcome.\r\n\r\nCopyright notice: Some of the code is loosely based on [matagus's webservice example](https://github.com/matagus/node-webservice-example)\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/liquid/node-restful-webservice-example.png)](http://travis-ci.org/liquid/node-restful-webservice-example)","tagline":"An example web service API implementation on top of Node.js.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
