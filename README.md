Node.js RESTful Web service example
===================================

This is an example project for a web service API implementation on top of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org).

The aim is to have a sample application for people that are new to the Node.js world and need an example application that implements the following design goals:

* The API should conform with the [representational state transfer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RESTful) design
* the API should have great test coverage
* the application should have [continuous integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) set up
* the application should conform with the [DRY principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself)

NOTE: This is a work in progress. Contributions and/or suggestions are welcome.
